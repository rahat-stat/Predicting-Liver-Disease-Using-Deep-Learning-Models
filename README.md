# Predicting-Liver-Disease-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
Used Kaggle Dataset in this analysis. Primarily dataset is cleaned. A ready to use dataset used in several models.
This repository presents a deep learning–based approach for predicting liver disease using patient clinical and biochemical data. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC–AUC. The project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be applied in healthcare analytics to enhance early diagnosis and improve predictive reliability compared to traditional methods.
